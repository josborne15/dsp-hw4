# dsp-hw4
This repository contains the main python file and test suite python file for Homework #4 for DSP 539. This homework focused on determining the observed and possible number of kmers for a given set of genome sequence. It also generates the linguistic complexity of the sequence, which is the the proportion of kmers that are observed compared to the total possible number. The JO_HW4 file contains 4 functions: count_kmers, possible_kmers, linguistic_complexity, and kmer_graph. The test_HW file contains test test_count_kmers, test_possible_kmers, test_linguistic_complexity, and test_kmer_graph, which uses pytest to test the functions in JO_HW4. To run the JO_HW4 file, the user must import the file path to the text file that contains the genome sequences. For the count_kmers function, the user must input the length of the kmer size.
